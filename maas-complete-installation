# Prerequisite: 
# 1) Ubuntu Server OS installed on MAAS server in this case 16.04 LTS release
# 2) MAAS server should be NAT enabled before MAAS installation
# Below steps will install maas from packages
# Ref: https://docs.maas.io/2.3/en/installconfig-package-install

# At MAAS server do:
# show full list of maas packages 
apt-cache search maas

# Add a stable package repositories
sudo apt-add-repository -yu ppa:maas/stable

# Initial setup of MAAS environment 
sudo apt update 
sudo apt install maas -y

# Create admin user
sudo maas createadmin  

# Alternative way to create MAAS user with script
sudo maas createadmin --username=$PROFILE --emaail=$EMAIL_ADDRESS
ex. username = "vmaas201", password = "Super123"

#Import SSH keys - this can be done at web ui


# Now login to MAAS web UI to complete the user configuration
# At any web browser do: 
http://<your_maas_ip>:5240/MAAS

# At MAAS web UI to do:
# Fill in the details for the initial MAAS configuration  
# For DNS forwarder value, use nslookup command to get the DNS ip 

Region name = <MAAS name>   
DNS forwarder = <Upstream DNS ip address from nslookup yahoo.com>   
Choosing source = mass.io and Ubuntu images = 16.04 LTS release
SSH keys for admin = <add multiple keys from launchpad and Github or enter manually>

# To setup public key authentication for SSH manually:
# ref: https://www.ssh.com/ssh/keygen/
# At MAAS server do:
# execute the command at home directory
ssh-keygen

# copy the public key authentication  
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

# At MAAS web ui do: 
Paste the publick key generated from MAAS server to the SSH keys for admin entry 
Go to the "Subnets" tab 
Add Fabric to the MAAS in networks 
Add subnet to the Fabric  

# At "Add subnet" sub-page do: 
# Fill in the details for the dynamic range
Name = <name-of-subnet>
CIDR = <10.100.203.0/24>
Gateway IP = <10.100.201.1>
DNS = <10.100.201.1>
Fabric & VLAN = <choose the fabric to be linked with the subnet>
Reserve range = <enter the start IP address and the end IP address>

# Turn on DHCP
Select default VLAN assigned to the Fabric under column VLAN
Set the Rack controller that will manage DHCP (in this case the "MAAS")
From the "Take action" button, select "Provide DHCP"

# Enlist and commission servers
# At target node BIOS:
Set all servers to PXE boot (make sure the right NIC interface as the boot device)
Set IPMI to DHCP mode  
Boot each machine. Machines will be automatically enlisted in the Nodes tab
Select all machines and "Commission" them using the "Take action" button
Once machines are in "Ready" status, you can start deploying

# To add virtual node to these steps below:
# MAAS with KVM 
# ref: https://docs.maas.io/2.3/en/nodes-add
# The procedure below is to add nodes via a Pod 

# At MAAS node do:
sudo apt install libvirt-bin -y

# Generating SSH private/pub key 'maas' user.. (in case no private/pub key generated)
# Remember this is key pair for 'maas' user!!!!
sudo chsh -s /bin/bash maas
sudo su - maas
ssh-keygen -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa -N ''

# Copy public key to the target node (from MAAS to KVM host in this case)
# Remember this is still under 'mass' user shell/console!!!
# Where $KVM_HOST represents the IP address of the KVM host 
# $USER represents a user on the KVM host with the permission to communicate with the libvirt daemon
# NOTE: user_name = User Name of KVM Host (ex. 'acd')
# NOTE: ip_address = IP address of the host bridge (ex. br201 - 10.100.201.2)

# Example "ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa acd@10.100.201.2
ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa $USER@$host_bridge_ipaddr

# Testing connection between MAAS and bridge-to-KVM:
virsh -c qemu+ssh://$USER@$host_bridge_ipaddr/system list --all
#ex. virsh -c qemu+ssh://acd@10.100.201.2/system list --all

# Exit from 'maas' user shell
exit

# Go and read - Add nodes via a Pod section (adding KVM VMs)...
# https://docs.maas.io/2.3/en/nodes-comp-hw
# NOTE: user_name = User Name of KVM Host (ex. 'acd')
# NOTE: ip_address = IP address of the host bridge (ex. br201 - 10.100.201.2)  
At MAAS web UI do:
Go to Pods menu and add pod
Select Pod type to "Virsh virtual system" 
Enter the Virsh address = "qemu+ssh://<user_name>@<ip_address>/system" 
Save pod
