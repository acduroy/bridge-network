# Prerequisite: MAAS by now installation is completed

# MAAS with KVM 
# ref: https://docs.maas.io/2.3/en/nodes-add
# The procedure below is to add nodes via a Pod 

# At MAAS node do:
sudo apt install libvirt-bin -y

# Generating SSH private/pub key 'maas' user.. (in case no private/pub key generated)
# Remember this is key pair for 'maas' user!!!!
sudo chsh -s /bin/bash maas
sudo su - maas
ssh-keygen -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa -N ''

# Copy public key to the target node (from MAAS to KVM host in this case)
# Remember this is still under 'mass' user shell/console!!!
# Where $KVM_HOST represents the IP address of the KVM host 
# $USER represents a user on the KVM host with the permission to communicate with the libvirt daemon
# NOTE: user_name = User Name of KVM Host (ex. 'acd')
# NOTE: ip_address = IP address of the host bridge (ex. br201 - 10.100.201.2)

# Example "ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa acd@10.100.201.2
ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa $USER@$KVM_HOST

# Testing connection between MAAS and KVM-Host:
virsh -c qemu+ssh://$USER@$KVM_HOST/system list --all

# Exit from 'maas' user shell
exit

# Go and read - Add nodes via a Pod section (adding KVM VMs)...
# https://docs.maas.io/2.3/en/nodes-comp-hw
# NOTE: user_name = User Name of KVM Host (ex. 'acd')
# NOTE: ip_address = IP address of the host bridge (ex. br201 - 10.100.201.2)  
At MAAS web UI do:
Go to Pods menu and add pod
Select Pod type to "Virsh virtual system" 
Enter the Virsh address = "qemu+ssh://<user_name>@<ip_address>/system" 
Save pod
